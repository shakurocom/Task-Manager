![](resources/TaskManager.svg)

Using Operation and OperationQueues you can create your own operations, encapsulating a unit of logic. You can specify and read a few additional properties to further encapsulate logic within the operation itself and keep track of its state. You can also specify a completionBlock that runs when an operation completes.
